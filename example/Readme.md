## Examples

### Markdown

### HTML (for specifying height/width)

>`<img src="example.png" width="50%" alt="this is an example image">`

#### Multiple images?

If you have multiple images to show, it is recommended that you add them to a table in order to keep them organized and on the same line. Images in a table can only utilize Markdown image rendering.

| Column 1      | Column 2      |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| ![example.png](example.png) | ![example.png](example.png) |
| ![example.png](example.png) | ![example.png](example.png) |
